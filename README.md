# Baby Monitor

**[babymonitor.online](https://babymonitor.online)**

Privacy-first, peer-to-peer audio baby monitor that runs entirely in the browser. No accounts, no servers storing your audio, no tracking.

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [v0](https://v0.app).

## How It Works

1. **Start Monitoring** on the device near the baby (sender)
2. A **QR code** appears instantly -- scan it with your phone (receiver)
3. The sender **approves** the connection request
4. Audio streams **directly between devices** via WebRTC -- no server in the middle

```
Sender (Baby)                    Receiver (Parent)
    |                                |
    |--- QR Code / Link ----------->|
    |                                |
    |<-- Connection Request ---------|
    |    (device type + IP shown)    |
    |                                |
    |--- Approve / Reject --------->|
    |                                |
    |<=== Encrypted Audio (P2P) ===>|
    |    (WebRTC, no server)         |
```

## Features

- **Instant QR** -- QR code shows immediately, mic setup runs in background
- **Sender approval** -- sender sees device type and IP of each connection request
- **Session locking** -- after first approval, no other device can connect
- **Reconnect** -- receiver can disconnect and reconnect within 30 minutes (auto-approved, same browser only)
- **Muted by default** -- receiver starts muted with always-visible audio level meter
- **Session cleanup** -- when sender stops, the session is deleted and receiver is notified
- **Privacy** -- audio never touches a server; signaling data auto-expires

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack)
- **React 19**
- **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer audio
- **Web Audio API** for real-time level metering
- **Upstash Redis** for signaling (deployed) / in-memory (local dev)
- **shadcn/ui** + **Tailwind CSS** for UI
- **qrcode.react** for QR generation

## Getting Started

### Local Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). To test with a second device on the same WiFi, the app automatically detects your local network IP and uses it in the QR code.

### Deploy to Vercel

The app deploys to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) with one click. You need to provision **Upstash Redis** for signaling to work across serverless function instances:

```bash
vercel link
vercel integration add upstash/upstash-kv
vercel env pull .env.local
```

Environment variables needed (auto-provisioned by the integration):
- `KV_REST_API_URL`
- `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`

## Architecture

### Signaling

WebRTC requires a signaling server to exchange connection details (SDP offers/answers, ICE candidates). This app uses:

- **Upstash Redis** (deployed) -- persists across serverless invocations, auto-expires via TTL
- **In-memory Map** with `globalThis` (local dev) -- survives HMR reloads

The signaling server only handles the brief initial handshake. Once connected, audio flows directly between devices.

### Security Model

- **Sender approval required** -- every new listener must be explicitly approved
- **Session locking** -- after first approval, the session rejects all other devices
- **Browser binding** -- the approved receiver's ID is stored in `localStorage`, only that browser can reconnect
- **Auto-expiry** -- sessions expire after 30 minutes of the last activity
- **Sender cleanup** -- stopping the sender immediately deletes the session
